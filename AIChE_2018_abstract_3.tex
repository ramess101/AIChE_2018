%	1. Accurate prediction of viscosity necessitate reliable non-bonded potentials that extrapolate well to high pressures, i.e. that they predict accurate densities and viscosities
%	2. Isooctane is used as a surrogate compound
%	3. CH3, CH2, CH, and C parameters are optimized simultaneously to REFPROP
	
	Accurate prediction of viscosity $(\eta)$ at high pressures $(P)$ necessitates an extremely reliable force field for at least two reasons. First, the viscosity at a given density $(\rho)$ is highly sensitive to the non-bonded function form and associated parameters. Second, the viscosity depends strongly on the predicted density, which is also very sensitive to the force field. 
	
	Since the challenge compound is 2,2,4-trimethylhexane (TMH), we chose 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (TMP, a.k.a. isooctane) as a surrogate molecule. Specifically, the optimal non-bonded parameters are obtained empirically by minimizing the deviation between the predicted and REFPROP $P\rho T$ and caloric properties for TMP. The CH$_3$, CH$_2$, CH, and C non-bonded parameters are optimized simultaneously. This high-dimensional parameterization is possible by reweighting configurations using Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) and by including several properties over a wide range of state points.  
	
	Uncertainties in the estimated TMH viscosity are obtained using three complementary methods. First, we use the deviation between the simulated and REFPROP $\eta$ values for the surrogate compound, TMP, at the target temperatures and pressures. Second, we account for the uncertainty in $\eta$ that is associated with uncertainties in $\rho$ for a given $P$. Third, we propagate the uncertainty in the force field non-bonded parameters using Bayesian inference.
